**PyEngine**

PyEngine â€” A lightweight, C++ game engine powered by Vulkan.

Hi! I'm 15 years old and currently studying at a vocational high school focused on software development. I created PyEngine to learn game engine development and Vulkan programming, and to provide a simple yet efficient engine for small projects and learning purposes.

PyEngine is designed to provide game developers with a simple yet efficient engine for handling core game logic and rendering. Built on Vulkan, it offers high-performance graphics while maintaining a modular and easy-to-understand structure. Perfect for learning, prototyping, or small-to-medium scale game projects.

**Features**

High-performance Vulkan rendering

Core game loop and scene management

Input handling (keyboard & mouse)

Basic physics and collision system

Modular and extensible architecture
